# Bitcamp-JAMStack

The JAMstack is a modern web development architecture based on client-side and it doesnâ€™t depend on a web server. The JAMstack is a static HTML site, rebuilt automatically every time you update the content, and deployed directly to a CDN.

**Why Learn JAMStack?**

For beginners to programming and computer science, Alexa skills teach all the major paradigms of software engineering, without being unapproachable. For experienced programmers, there is a great opportunity to build, share, and get feedback from the community on your apps.

**What will the student work on?**

The students will create a personal portfolio website on the JAMStack, with Gatsby, Netlify, and Cloudinary.  

## Learning Objectives:

### **Week 1**

Create your first Gatsby site

**Objective: *Building our first Gatsby site***

- Environment setup
- Gatsby Pages
- Linking Pages with Gatsby

**Homework**

- Start their own repo with their own Gatsby site. 
    - Goal: get more familiar with the iterative testing and development


### **Week 2**

Creating Shared Components

**Objective: *Add a feature to your app using one such API***

- What is a System function API
- See what other apps use them (timers, notifications, etc.)
- How your skill's responses use these and display the output

**Homework**

- Find an API you would like to add (we list the main options)
- Add a new feature to your app that uses that API

### **Week 3**

Learn about the backend features that Alexa skills have access to, and use them for your app

**Objective: *Get an Application API integrated into your app***

- What is an Application API
- How does a request interface with them
- Demonstrating adding one to your workflow

**Homework**

- Find an API you would like to add (we provide some starting options)
- Add a new feature to your app that uses that API

### **Week 4**

The 'marketplace week'. Launching your app to the store, tracking anlaytics, and other APIs

**Objective: *Launch your apps!***

- How to publish an Alexa app to the store
- How to track information about downloads, usage, etc.
- Learning what other API's are available outside of System and Application from prev. weeks

**Homework**

- Launch their app and download it on their device (if they have one, not required)
- Find another API they would like to add to their app
    - Can be another type from before or a new one (transactions, smart home, account-linking, etc.)
- Add that API to their previous app


### **Final Project**

The final project is the culmination of your previous weeks of work. You should have the power and resources to add features, create a development plan, and launch your own app with these skills.

Now, do it! You can borrow work from previous weeks, but you get to create an app with whatever API's and features you want in this final stretch. Start with the appropriate template and research which features you're going to need, then write your functions and launch your new app!
